# 🎙️ Voice Recognition

VoiceDesk uses **whisper.cpp** for local speech-to-text processing.

```text
Microphone
    │
    ▼
Audio Capture
    │
    ▼
whisper.cpp
    │
    ▼
Recognized Text
    │
    ▼
SafetyEngine
    │
    ▼
CommandParser
    │
    ▼
CommandExecutor
```

The current application uses an English Whisper model.

The model is intentionally excluded from Git because Whisper model files are large.

The current runtime configuration uses:

```text
third_party/whisper.cpp/models/ggml-small.en.bin
```

---

# 🧠 Natural-Language Command Parsing

VoiceDesk accepts different natural-language variations for supported intents.

For example:

```text
open firefox
Open Firefox
please open Firefox
launch Firefox
start Firefox
```

These can resolve to the same application-opening intent.

Supported command categories include:

```text
UNKNOWN
OPEN_APPLICATION
OPEN_URL
SEARCH_WEB
CLOSE_APPLICATION
SYSTEM_INFO
SHOW_PROCESSES
LIST_FILES
CREATE_FILE
DELETE_FILE
DISK_INFO
NETWORK_INFO
CPU_USAGE
MEMORY_USAGE
UPTIME
LOAD_AVERAGE
KERNEL_INFO
HELP
EXIT
```

---

# 🛡️ Safety Engine

VoiceDesk validates commands before they reach the execution layer.

```text
Raw User Input
      │
      ▼
SafetyEngine
      │
      ├──────── Unsafe ────────► BLOCK
      │
      ▼
CommandParser
      │
      ▼
CommandExecutor
```

Dangerous command patterns include examples such as:

```text
rm -rf /
rm -rf /*
mkfs
dd if=
shutdown
reboot
poweroff
```

Example:

```text
User:
rm -rf /

VoiceDesk:
VoiceDesk Safety Engine:
This command has been blocked for security reasons.
```

The SafetyEngine is the primary application-level safety mechanism.

The Linux character device driver provides user-space ↔ kernel-space communication and is not the application's primary safety authority.

---

# 🖥️ Application Management

VoiceDesk uses controlled application matching instead of unrestricted arbitrary application execution.

Supported application examples include:

```text
firefox
vscode
terminal
vlc
file manager
```

Examples:

```text
open firefox
open vscode
open terminal

close firefox
```

---

# 🌐 Web & Browser Commands

VoiceDesk supports predefined web destinations:

```text
open google
open youtube
open github
open gmail
open whatsapp
open linkedin
open reddit
open chatgpt
```

Users can also open valid URLs:

```text
open https://example.com
```

Web searching:

```text
search google for Linux device drivers
search for C++ tutorials
```

YouTube search variations:

```text
search youtube for Python tutorials
search youtube Python tutorials
youtube search Python tutorials
find on youtube Python tutorials
play on youtube Python tutorials
```

Normal visible browser opening continues to use the existing Linux desktop browser mechanism.

---

# 🦊 Firefox WebDriver BiDi

VoiceDesk includes a dedicated Firefox WebDriver BiDi client.

Source files:

```text
include/firefox_bidi_client.hpp
src/firefox_bidi_client.cpp
```

The BiDi layer supports:

- WebSocket connection
- WebDriver BiDi session creation
- Browsing-context discovery
- JavaScript evaluation
- Page navigation
- Session termination
- JSON-safe command construction

The automation layer is separate from the normal visible browser-opening functionality.

## Firefox BiDi Endpoint

The current Firefox automation endpoint is:

```text
ws://127.0.0.1:9222
```

Start Firefox for BiDi automation:

```bash
firefox --headless --no-remote \
  --remote-debugging-port 9222 \
  --remote-allow-hosts localhost \
  --remote-allow-origins http://localhost:9222 \
  -remote-allow-system-access \
  >/tmp/voicedesk-firefox.log 2>&1 &
```

Verify the port:

```bash
ss -ltnp | grep ':9222'
```

Check the log:

```bash
cat /tmp/voicedesk-firefox.log
```

The implemented BiDi functionality has been tested with:

```text
session.new
browsingContext.getTree
script.evaluate
browsingContext.navigate
session.end
```

Example architecture:

```text
VoiceDesk
    │
    ▼
Firefox BiDi Client
    │
    ▼
WebSocket
    │
    ▼
Firefox
    │
    ▼
Web Page
```

---

# 📂 File Management

VoiceDesk supports controlled file operations.

## List Files

```text
list files
```

## Create a File

```text
create file test.txt
```

## Delete a File

```text
delete file test.txt
```

Destructive file operations require confirmation.

Example:

```text
VoiceDesk Confirmation Required
---------------------------------
Action: Delete file

Target: test.txt

Are you sure? (y/n):
```

---

# ⚙️ Process Management

VoiceDesk can display running Linux processes.

```text

---

# 🔌 Linux Character Device Driver

VoiceDesk includes a custom Linux character device driver.

Driver:

```text
driver/voicedesk_driver.c
```

Device:

```text
/dev/voicedesk
```

The driver demonstrates:

- Linux kernel modules
- Character devices
- Major and minor numbers
- `cdev`
- File operations
- Device classes
- `device_create()`
- `copy_to_user()`
- `copy_from_user()`
- Kernel mutex synchronization
- Kernel logging
- Module initialization
- Module cleanup

---

# 🔄 User-Space ↔ Kernel-Space Communication

VoiceDesk contains a dedicated driver client:

```text
include/device_driver_client.hpp
src/device_driver_client.cpp
```

Communication path:

```text
┌───────────────────────────────┐
│       VoiceDesk C++           │
│          User Space           │
└───────────────┬───────────────┘
                │
                │ open()
                │ write()
                │ read()
                │ close()
                ▼
┌───────────────────────────────┐
│        /dev/voicedesk         │
└───────────────┬───────────────┘
                │
                ▼
┌───────────────────────────────┐
│     Linux Character Driver    │
│          Kernel Space         │
└───────────────────────────────┘
```

Conceptually:

```cpp
DeviceDriverClient driver_("/dev/voicedesk");

driver_.sendCommand("open firefox");
```

---

# 🔐 Driver Synchronization

The character driver protects shared command-buffer state using a Linux kernel mutex.

```text
Process A ──┐
Process B ──┼──► Mutex ──► Driver Buffer
Process C ──┘
```

This protects shared driver state from concurrent access.

---

ls -l /dev/voicedesk
```

Check kernel messages:

```bash
dmesg | grep voicedesk
```

Typical driver messages may include:

```text
voicedesk: driver loaded
voicedesk: device opened
voicedesk: received command: open firefox
voicedesk: device closed
```

These messages demonstrate communication between the VoiceDesk application and the Linux character driver.

---

# 🏛️ Software Architecture Concepts

VoiceDesk demonstrates:

### Modular Architecture

Each major responsibility is implemented as an independent component.

### Separation of Concerns

Voice recognition, safety, parsing, execution, browser automation, system monitoring, file management, and driver communication are separated.

### Encapsulation

C++ classes expose focused interfaces for individual subsystems.

### Defensive Programming

Commands are validated before execution.

### Layered Architecture

```text

Recognition
  ↓
Safety
  ↓
Parsing
  ↓
Execution
  ↓
Linux / Browser / Driver
  ↓
Kernel
```

### User-Space / Kernel-Space Separation

Desktop operations remain in user space while the character driver demonstrates controlled kernel communication.

---

# 🔬 Linux Character Driver Concepts

The driver demonstrates concepts including:

```text
module_init()
module_exit()

alloc_chrdev_region()
cdev_init()
cdev_add()

class_create()
device_create()

copy_to_user()
copy_from_user()

mutex
```

File operations include:

```text
open
read
write
release
```

---

# ❓ Why a Character Device?

A Linux character device provides a standard file-like interface between user-space applications and kernel-space drivers.

VoiceDesk uses:

```text
/dev/voicedesk
```

The C++ application communicates with the driver through standard Linux operations:

```text
open()
read()
write()
close()
```

This creates a clear user-space ↔ kernel-space boundary suitable for demonstrating Linux systems programming concepts.

---

# 🔐 Public Repository Security

VoiceDesk is intended to remain publicly accessible.

**Never commit sensitive information**, including:

```text
API keys
Access tokens
Passwords
Private SSH keys
Cloud credentials
.env files containing secrets
Authentication tokens
Private certificates
Personal credentials
```

Build artifacts and downloaded Whisper models should remain excluded through `.gitignore`.

Before pushing changes:

```bash
git status
git diff --cached
```

If a secret is accidentally committed:

1. Remove it from repository history.
2. Rotate the exposed credential.
3. Verify that the replacement credential is not stored in the repository.

# ⚠️ Current Limitations

- Application execution is controlled through predefined application matching.
- Speech recognition requires whisper.cpp and a local Whisper model.
- Voice capture depends on the Linux audio environment.
- Speech recognition quality depends on the selected model and microphone/audio conditions.
- Firefox BiDi requires Firefox to be running with the appropriate remote debugging configuration.
- The character driver is primarily a Linux kernel communication and educational component rather than a physical hardware driver.
- Driver compilation requires a compatible Linux kernel development/source environment.
- Kernel ABI changes may require rebuilding the driver.
- Some desktop applications may behave differently under WSL2/WSLg than on a native Linux desktop.
- The current system is intentionally command-driven rather than GUI-driven.

---

# 🔮 Future Improvements

Potential future improvements include:

- Wake-word detection
- Multilingual speech recognition
- Improved intent classification
- More desktop applications
- Advanced Firefox automation
- Browser tab management
- Page interaction through WebDriver BiDi
